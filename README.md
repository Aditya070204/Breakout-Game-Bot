# Breakout-Game-Bot
Using Reinforcement Learning Algorithm PPO train a model that can train itself in playing the breakout independently and can even surpass human performance in the game. The model is trained for 20 million timesteps
which can be reduced by decreasing the iterations in the loop and decreasing total timesteps in 'dynamic_lr' class.
